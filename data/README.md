# Data Directory Structure

This directory contains all data files used and generated by the OKR project.

## Directory Structure

- **`raw/`** - Raw data files as received from data sources
  - Input datasets
  - External API responses
  - Log files
  
- **`processed/`** - Intermediate processed data
  - Cleaned datasets
  - Feature-engineered data
  - Temporary processing outputs
  
- **`final/`** - Final processed data and model outputs
  - Training datasets
  - Model predictions
  - Evaluation results
  - Production-ready data

## Data Flow

1. Raw data is ingested into `raw/` folder
2. Data processing pipelines transform raw data into processed data in `processed/` folder
3. Final outputs and model results are stored in `final/` folder

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names with timestamps
- Include data source and version information
- Use consistent date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Example: `customer_data_2024-01-15_v1.csv`

## Data Privacy

- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude data files
- Implement proper access controls for production data
