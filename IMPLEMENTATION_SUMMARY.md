# OKR ML Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Issues Addressed and Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed Unit Tests
**Issue**: `ERROR: file or directory not found: tests/`
**Solution**: 
- Created `/workspace/tests/` directory with proper structure
- Added `__init__.py`, `conftest.py`, and `test_basic.py`
- Tests now run successfully: `3 passed, 1 skipped`

### ‚úÖ 2. Enhanced Dashboard with Sidebar & Navbar
**Issue**: Need comprehensive dashboard with clear navigation
**Solution**:
- Created `dashboard_main.py` - Enhanced main control center
- Created `dashboard_templates/enhanced_dashboard.html` - Modern UI with:
  - Collapsible sidebar navigation
  - Top navbar with system status
  - Service management cards
  - Real-time monitoring charts
  - File management interface
  - WebSocket integration for live updates

### ‚úÖ 3. Fixed MLflow Integration
**Issue**: MLflow not working properly
**Solution**:
- Fixed `start_mlflow_server.sh` with `--break-system-packages` flag
- Created `start_mlflow_simple.sh` - Simplified, reliable MLflow startup
- Enhanced error handling and dependency management
- Added proper health checks and server readiness verification

### ‚úÖ 4. Enhanced File Upload/Download Functionality
**Issue**: File upload and download must work clearly
**Solution**:
- **Enhanced Upload**: 
  - File type validation (CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF, ZIP, etc.)
  - Automatic file processing and metadata extraction
  - Security checks to prevent directory traversal
  - Real-time progress tracking
- **Enhanced Download**: 
  - Secure file serving with logging
  - Download statistics tracking
  - Multiple folder support (uploads/downloads)
- **Additional Features**:
  - File deletion with security checks
  - File reprocessing capability
  - Enhanced file listing with metadata
  - File size formatting and type descriptions

### ‚úÖ 5. Organized GitHub Actions with Clear Dependencies
**Issue**: GitHub actions must be in separate files with clear flow
**Solution**:
- **Step 1: Test & Validation** (`1-test.yml`)
  - Code formatting, linting, unit tests
  - Project structure validation
  - Docker configuration validation
  - Security scanning
- **Step 2: Build & Package** (`2-build.yml`)
  - Application packaging
  - Docker image building
  - Release notes generation
  - Artifact management
- **Step 3: Deploy** (`3-deploy.yml`)
  - Staging and production deployments
  - Health checks and validation
  - Rollback capabilities
  - Deployment notifications

**Dependency Flow**: Test ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Deploy (each step depends on the previous)

### ‚úÖ 6. Cleaned Up DAGs - Removed Duplicates
**Issue**: Remove unnecessary and duplicated DAGs
**Solution**:
- **Removed Duplicates**:
  - `model_training_pipeline.py` (kept comprehensive `model_training.py`)
  - `monitoring_pipeline.py` (kept comprehensive `monitoring.py`)
- **Organized Remaining DAGs**:
  - `etl_pipeline.py` - Complete data ingestion and ETL
  - `enhanced_api_ingestion_dag.py` - API data ingestion
  - `enhanced_csv_ingestion_dag.py` - CSV file processing
  - `model_training.py` - ML model training and management
  - `monitoring.py` - System and model monitoring
- **Added Documentation**: `src/dags/README.md` with clear DAG purposes and dependencies

### ‚úÖ 7. Removed Unused Files
**Issue**: Remove unused files from the project
**Solution**:
- Cleaned up Python cache files (`*.pyc`, `__pycache__`)
- Removed large log files (>10MB)
- Removed system files (`.DS_Store`)
- Removed old GitHub workflow files (replaced with organized step-based workflows)
