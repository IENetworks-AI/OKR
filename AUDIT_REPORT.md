# OKR ML Pipeline - Comprehensive Audit Report

## üîç Executive Summary

This audit report identifies critical integration issues and optimization opportunities across the OKR ML Pipeline project. The analysis covers Docker services, API integration, database setup, Kafka streaming, Python dependencies, and configuration consistency.

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 2. **PostgreSQL Vector Extension Issue**
- **Problem**: Line 101 in `deploy/postgres/init/001_dbs_and_extensions.sql` has commented out vector extension
- **Impact**: Vector embeddings functionality is disabled
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Feature incomplete

### 3. **Configuration Path Inconsistencies**
- **Problem**: Multiple hardcoded paths in API and different path resolution strategies
- **Impact**: Configuration loading may fail in different environments
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Reliability issue

### 4. **Service Health Check Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Some services may start before dependencies are fully ready
- **Impact**: Intermittent startup failures
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Reliability issue
