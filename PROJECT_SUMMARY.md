  - Changed restart policy to `unless-stopped`
  - Added resource limits and logging configuration
  - Optimized health checks and timeouts
- ✅ Configured for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure deployment
- ✅ Updated nginx configuration for Oracle IP

### 4. Dashboard Enhancement
- ✅ Completely redesigned dashboard for clarity and usability
- ✅ Added pipeline workflow visualization
- ✅ Integrated system health monitoring
- ✅ Added direct controls for triggering DAGs
- ✅ Simplified interface focused on pipeline operations

### 5. Data Pipeline Optimization
- ✅ Verified DAGs work with real data from `data/raw/` directory
- ✅ Ensured Kafka integration is properly configured
- ✅ Added demo OKR data to `data/raw/` for immediate processing
- ✅ Confirmed end-to-end data flow works correctly

### 6. MLflow Integration
- ✅ Verified MLflow tracking is properly configured
- ✅ Confirmed model training DAGs log to MLflow
- ✅ Ensured experiment tracking works end-to-end
- ✅ Added MLflow UI access through main dashboard

## 🚀 How to Use the Optimized System

### Local Development
```bash
# See LOCAL_SETUP.md for detailed instructions
./start-workflow.sh
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# See ORACLE_DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed instructions
sudo ./deploy/oracle-setup.sh
```

### Using the Pipeline
1. **Add Data**: Place CSV files in `data/raw/`
2. **Start Processing**: Use dashboard controls or trigger DAGs via API
3. **Monitor Progress**: Check Airflow UI, MLflow UI, or dashboard
4. **View Results**: Access processed data through the API or database

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Production Ready
